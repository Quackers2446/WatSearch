## Data Sources

The application supports multiple ways to add course data:

### Option 1: Browser Extension (Recommended)

1. **Install the Browser Extension**:
   - See [browser-extension/README.md](browser-extension/README.md) for detailed instructions
   - Load the extension from the `browser-extension/` folder
   - Configure it to connect to your local WatSearch instance

2. **Use the Extension**:
   - Navigate to [outline.uwaterloo.ca](https://outline.uwaterloo.ca) and view your enrolled courses
   - Open the extension popup and select which terms to process
   - Click "Process Selected Course Outlines" to automatically extract and add all course details
   - The extension extracts HTML directly from authenticated pages and sends it to WatSearch

### Option 2: Manual Upload via Web Interface

2. Download a course outline from [outline.uwaterloo.ca](https://outline.uwaterloo.ca):
   - Search for your course

3. Upload the HTML file through the WatSearch upload interface
4. The course data will be automatically parsed and added
