# WatSearch Enhanced Browser Extension

## üöÄ Enhanced Features

The WatSearch browser extension now supports **link following** and **multi-page data extraction**! Instead of just looking at the current page, the extension can now:

- **Follow Links**: Automatically navigate to assignment pages, content pages, and announcements
- **Extract Deep Data**: Get detailed information from individual pages
- **Multi-Page Collection**: Collect data from up to 20 pages per course
- **Smart Prioritization**: Focus on high-priority content like assignments first

## üîç How It Works

### 1. **Table of Contents Analysis**

When you're on a LEARN course page, the extension:

1. Scans the table of contents for links
2. Identifies assignments, quizzes, exams, and content
3. Prioritizes high-value content (assignments first)

### 2. **Link Following**

The extension then:

1. Follows each link to get detailed information
2. Extracts specific data from each page
3. Combines all data into a comprehensive dataset

### 3. **Smart Data Extraction**

For each page visited, the extension extracts:

- **Assignments**: Title, description, due date, points
- **Announcements**: Title, content, date
- **Content**: Course materials, readings, resources

## üìä What Data is Collected

### From LEARN Table of Contents:

- **Course Information**: Name, code, term
- **Assignment Links**: All assignments, quizzes, exams
- **Content Links**: Course materials, lessons, resources
- **Announcement Links**: Course announcements, news

### From Individual Pages:

- **Assignment Details**: Full descriptions, due dates, grading info
- **Announcement Content**: Complete announcement text and dates
- **Content Materials**: Readings, resources, course content

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Settings in `config.js`:

```javascript
const WATSEARCH_CONFIG = {
  maxPages: 20, // Maximum pages to visit
  maxDepth: 3, // Maximum link depth
  delayBetweenRequests: 1000, // Delay between requests

  contentTypes: {
    assignments: true, // Extract assignments
    announcements: true, // Extract announcements
    quizzes: true, // Extract quizzes
    exams: true, // Extract exams
    content: true, // Extract course content

  },
};
```

    totalPages: 15            // Number of pages visited
  }
}
```

## üîß Technical Details

1. **Parse Table of Contents**: Extract all relevant links
2. **Prioritize Content**: Sort by importance (assignments first)
3. **Follow Links**: Visit each page and extract data
4. **Combine Results**: Merge all extracted data

### Error Handling:

- **Failed Requests**: Skip failed pages and continue
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect server limits with delays
- **Timeout Protection**: Prevent hanging requests

### Performance:

- **Concurrent Limits**: Maximum 3 concurrent requests
- **Memory Management**: Clean up after each page

## üö® Important Notes

### Privacy & Security:

- **Respectful Scraping**: Uses delays to avoid overwhelming servers

### Limitations:
